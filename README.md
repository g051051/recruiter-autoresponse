# recruiter-autoresponse
Based on the Medium Article entitled - "Career Advice Nobody Gave Me: Never ignore a recruiter" this repo has a copyable script which you can use to auto-respond to recruiters.

This is licensed under MIT so please feel free to fork and use as you'd like. 

If you like it, please consider leaving a github star.  I think that it would be super cool to see how many people this helps.

Thanks for reaching out. I'm always interested in hearing about what new and exciting opportunities are out there. As a senior software engineer with decades of experience, I'm sure you can imagine that I get a very high volume of recruiters reaching out on LinkedIn.  Having in-demand skills is a great position to be in!

It does however mean that I don't have the time to hop on a call with everyone who reaches out. A lot of the time, incoming messages represent a very poor fit indeed.  While I very much appreciate the fact that exceptionally talented and engaged recruiters reach out consistently, sorting serious and high quality opportunities from spam would be a full time job without an autoresponder.

I would love to continue the conversation, but before I do, I'd like to level set around the level of seniority that you're looking for.  Is this really a role suitable for an industry veteran with 30+ years of experience?  Note that at this stage of my career, I'm not willing to submit myself to the ridiculous practices that seem to be the used in hiring nowadays.  I.E. I won't take any standardized tests, waste my time solving silly "leetcode" type puzzles, do take-home assignments, etc.

I am only considering full-time permanent remote work, so no contract, temp-to-perm, or requirements to ever come into an office.

Can you send along the company name, a job description, and total compensation details for the role you're reaching out in reference to?  In the absence of detailed information regarding the nature of the opportunity in question, I will be unavailable for further discussion.

Thanks again for reaching out, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Dan
